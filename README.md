## Project Description

This website will display a collection of some of the projects I've worked on. It will have a 

## API and Data Sample

Specify the API you are using and include a link. Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|June 8| Project Prompt | Incomplete
|June 9| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|June 10| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|June 11| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|June 12| MVP | Incomplete
|June 15| Present | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  
#### Your application must meet these requirements:

  1. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  1. Styled using `Flexbox` or `Grid`.
  1. Use Axios to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM.
  1. Fulfill the build requirements you have specified in your MVP.
  2. Deployed to a site hosting service like [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
  3. Make commits to GitHub every day.
  4. A `README.md` file that contains your project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as ```npm i```.

#### ðŸ“‹ List of APIs

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some free APIs you can use. There are _many_ APIs out there, however, so if you find one not on this list, feel free to use it. No matter what API you decide on, make sure you can successfully make a GET request before you commit to using it.

  1. Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api
  1. News: https://newsapi.org/
  1. Giphy: https://developers.giphy.com/
  1. Pokemon: http://pokeapi.co/
  1. Card Deck: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
  1. City of Chicago: https://data.cityofchicago.org/
  1. Beer: https://www.brewerydb.com/developers
  1. Chuck Norris: http://www.icndb.com/
  1. Rick and Morty: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest
  
[This site](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) lists a collection APIs as well. Take a look through their libraries and try to find one that interests you. Please note, however, that many APIs will require an authentication key, and some APIs require payment. We **highly suggest** using a free API for your first project dealing with one.

### STEP 5: &#x1F535; Ideas for Post-MVP - Not Mandatory
- Look into [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so you can save data to the user's browser 
- Add a second API.
- Add creative use of event listeners and UI interaction.
- Add media queries for responsive design.
- Add animations.
- Get input from a UX student on how to make your app have intuitive UI and design.

### STEP 6: Technical Demonstration

All projects will be presented to the class.  Your presentation should:

* Be no longer than 5 minutes in length
* Show off all features of the app
* Explain the technical details
* Explain the technical challenges
* Explain which improvements you might make

Your presentation should **NOT**:
* Focus on what you didn't accomplish.

You will be sharing your project and your code.  Be prepared to answer questions from the instructors and other students.

Did you read all of the directions before starting? If so write `git commit -m "chill'n in outerspace"` instead of `git commit -m "first commit"` for your first commit.

### Step 7: Help and Support

1. Each student will be given 5 (five) tokens, redeemable at any time during regular class time (subject to instructors' schedules), for 20 minutes. **Tokens cannot be transferred between students - there is no black market for tokens.**

2. Give at least a 10 minutes heads up to an instructor with the link to your project repo and a link to your `issue` ticket. Instructors will not be holding open office hours during project week. This is to allow you to solve issues and errors you run in to on your own and with your classmates. 

3. [Sign up with your name and time here in the P1 Scheduler](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WKqFstmorPyNPmGIXsBwQ-0Xfd8NZr2BO_cqL9d0w64/edit#gid=804294796)

### Step 8: Grading

#### Hard Requirements

The following requirements **_must_** be met in order for the project to be
considered complete:

- The project is deployed to GitHub Pages or a custom domain
- The application renders in the browser and runs without errors
- The repo has a README that adequately documents the project

We do not give letter grades; it is either a pass/fail. The real benchmark is how much you grow and learn each unit. 

You will receive feedback in a secret gist. The gist will be Slacked out independent of your P1 repo to keep feedback confidential. 

An example of the gist can be found here: [Secret Gist](https://gist.git.generalassemb.ly/SteveVW/6b49d9b08d1edcd203609d843eb8b97f)

If you would like more feedback than the gist, instructors will be available to meet one on one. Please feel free to reach out and schedule a time with your squad leader. 

### Incomplete Projects

Incomplete projects will be given an extension. An instructor will follow up with you to discuss the details of the resubmission.  **Note that you are allowed one extension on only one of the four projects.**
