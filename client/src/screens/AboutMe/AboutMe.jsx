      <p>I am a Software Engineer who strives to use my passion for technology and my skills in web development to make meaningful contributions to the world. I have experience building full-stack applications with JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, HTML5, and CSS3 with technologies including PostgreSQL, and React. In the future, I look forward to also learning new skills that will help me stay on the cusp of where technology meets humanity.

      The power to express my creativity through my career and hobbies is one that I truly cherish. The road to this self-discovery was a long one for me but definitely one that I wouldn't change. I'm a firm believer that things tend to happen for a reason whether we can see it or not, and it is a culmination of all these thoughts and ideas that have brought me to be where I am today as a Software Engineer.

      Whenever I'm not expressing myself through my code, I'm doing so through music as a self-taught Audio Engineer, or through photography shooting whatever inspires me.

      I'm all about creation, expression, and paying it forward.
